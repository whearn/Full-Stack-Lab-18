# Lab 18: Return of the Chirps: A New Angle
## Due: Wednesday, June 28th, 10:30
##### Covalence
###### Full Stack: Summer 2017

## Info/Setup
* This project will be building on project 1
* Copy your package.json and client and server folders to this project folder
* Make sure this project folder has a `.gitignore` file with an entry for `node_modules`
* Run npm install on this project to install all your dependencies you need
* You should already have html files in your client folder for welcome, list, single view, and single update
* You will be transitioning this site to use AngularJS

## Objectives
* In your Express server code, remove all the route handlers for client routes (non-API routes)
* Make sure you are statically serving the client folder
* Rename index.html to welcome.html
* Create an index.html file in the client folder, bringing in the AngularJS and angular routing scripts from a CDN
    * Also bring in a new JS file you are going to create called app.js
* Create an Angular application as demonstrated in class. You should use routing. Specifically, the following routes should exist:
    * `/`: show welcome page
    * `/chirps`: show list page
    * `/chirps/some_id`: show single view page
    * `/chirps/some_id/update`: show single update page
* Remember, when you set up a route, you need to specify the html page to show, and the controller to make active
* The controller for the welcome page can be empty for now. We may add functionality in later.
* The controller for the list page should make two GET requests to the API for all chirps and all users
    * When you get the chirps back, they should be shown on the screen as before, but this time using ng-repeat!
    * Chirps should link to the single view for that chirp when clicked upon
    * Use ng-repeat to populate the options of the user select box
* The controller for the single chirp page should make a GET request to the API for the single chirp
    * Use bindings to make the data show on the screen
    * Clicking the delete button should make a DELETE request to the server and redirect back to the list page when successful
* The controller for the update chirp page should make a GET request to the API for the single chirp
    * The message of the chirp should be placed in the input box in the view using data binding
    * When the update button is clicked, rely on data-binding to get the new message and send the PUT request to the server
    * When the server indicates a successful update, redirect back to the single page or the list page


## Tips/Hints
* Remember, the html files for the views only need the html for the content of that page.
    * DO NOT have the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags. etc. Basically, only include what would normally be within the body tags.
* Your index.html will be the full html file, with script and stylesheet imports.
* To succeed in this lab, you need to understand $scope, data-binding, ng-repeat, ng-click, $http, and angular routing.
